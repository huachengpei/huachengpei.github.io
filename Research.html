<h2><b>Shared or Separate: Marital Stability and Corporate Risk-Taking</b></h2>
<p>with Wenjing Xie, 2022<br/>
<strong>Status</strong>: Submitted<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: Considering culture as an informal institutional constraint, we investigate the influence of marital stability on corporate risk-taking. The rising divorce-to-marriage ratio (DMR) and declining marital stability in society reflect the prevalent shifts towards individualism and decreasing collectivism. Utilizing the DMR as an indicator of marital stability, we examine its impact on corporate risk-taking using data from Chinese A-share listed firms between 2008 and 2020. Our findings reveal a significant negative effect of the DMR in the region where a firm is located on corporate risk-taking. Specifically, higher levels of marital stability in a region, indicated by lower DMR, are associated with increased levels of corporate risk-taking. Furthermore, this relationship is moderated by executives, who play a crucial role as decision-makers and implementers. The study highlights that female executives and those nearing retirement age are more influenced by marital stability, while executives with duality experience less impact.<br/>

<h2><b>Does the Institutional Distance of Marriage Contract Affect Corporate Marriage? Evidence from Material Asset Reorganizations</b></h2>
<p>with Wenjing Xie, 2022<br/>
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4478773" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[SSRN Link]</a><br/>
<strong>Status</strong>: Submitted<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper examines the influence of institutional distance of marriage contract on corporate material asset reorganizations (MARs). We investigate the impact of cultural values and trust embedded in the institution of marriage contract on MARs performance. By analyzing MARs data of listed companies from 2008 to 2019, we find that the institutional distance of marriage contract hinders inter-regional MARs, leading to a decreased likelihood, frequency, and scale of MARs. Additionally, we observe that the greater the institutional distance of marriage contract, the higher the probability of MARs failure. These effects are contingent on various managerial, corporate, and regional characteristics. This study contributes to the existing literature on the economic impact of institutional distance and provides practical and economic insights for listed companies in terms of MARs target selection, time cost reduction, and success rate enhancement.<br/>

<h2><b>Financial Support and Cultural Industry Exports: The French Experience and Insights</b></h2>
<p>with Wenjing Xie, and Yugui Zhang, 2022<br/>
<strong>Status</strong>: Submitted<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China introduced a strategic framework aimed at propelling the prosperity of the cultural industry, amplifying the influence of Chinese civilization, and advancing high-quality Chinese culture globally. This study draws insights from France's cultural industry development and employs empirical research to underscore the impact of France's cultural fiscal policies on its cultural exports. We find that the augmentation of financial backing in the cultural sector has demonstrably catalyzed cultural exports. Moreover, this influence exhibits heterogeneity due to international disparities. The potency of France's cultural financial support in boosting cultural exports is particularly pronounced when engaging with developed economies, members of the OIF, or nations with strong cultural influence. Synthesizing France's experiences, this study furnishes pertinent policy recommendations to steer the high-quality growth of China's cultural industry with precision and clarity.<br/>

<h2><b>Does the Healthy China 2030 Policy Improve People's Health? Empirical Evidence Based on the Difference-in-Difference Approach</b></h2>
<p>with Chuanlin Ning, Youjia Huang, and Sichen Li, 2023<br/>
<strong>Status</strong>: Submitted<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: The Healthy China 2030 (HC2030) policy is currently recognized as the most significant and influential national health policy in China. However, despite its implementation in 2016, the policy's impact has not been comprehensively evaluated, particularly in relation to its effectiveness in enhancing population health and promoting public health equity. Methods We utilized the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of the HC2030. Our analysis utilized a panel dataset derived from five longitudinal surveys conducted by the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). The implementation of HC2030 has improved the overall health status of residents, particularly in urban areas and the western and eastern regions. Mechanistic analysis has further unveiled that the policy's beneficial impact on health outcomes is attributed to a rise in physical activity frequency and the betterment of mental health. Additionally, female, married, and medically insured individuals have demonstrated a significant positive impact of the policy on their health outcomes. Although the HC2030 has effectively improved overall population health, it has not adequately promoted equity in public health. The study suggests adjustments are needed to address the unequal distribution of health outcomes between urban and rural areas and among different regions.<br/>

<h2><b>How Media Use Influences the Fertility Intentions Among Chinese Women of Reproductive Age: A Perspective of Social Trust</b></h2>
<p>with Chuanlin Ning, Jing Wu, Yijie Ye, Nan Yang, and Hao Gao<br/>
<i><u>Frontiers in Public Health</u></i>, 2022, 10, 88200910.<br/>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpubh.2022.882009" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Link]</a>     <a href="paper2.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[PDF]</a><br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: The low fertility level has become a serious social problem in China. Previous research has argued the significant influence of media use and social trust on fertility intentions, but the interaction between the two variables and how they influence fertility intentions remain further investigation. This study explored the influence mechanism of media use on Chinese women's fertility intentions from the perspective of social trust. This study collected data from the 2017 China General Social Survey, investigated the relationships between variables through bivariate correlation coefficients, and explored the differences in fertility intentions among women of reproductive age (20–49). Also, this paper examined the influence of media use and social trust by regression analysis and tested the mediating role of social trust between media use and fertility intentions with Bootstrap sampling. Women with different media use preferences, education levels, and family incomes have significant differences in fertility intentions. New media use negatively influences women's fertility intentions, while traditional media use has no significant influence on women's fertility intentions. Social trust significantly influenced women's fertility intentions and partially mediated the impact of new media use on fertility intentions. Online communication influences fertility intentions among Chinese women of reproductive age. It tends to influence their social trust by amplifying negative social news, affecting their fertility intentions further. This paper suggests the importance of strengthening social trust and online agenda-setting to improve women's fertility intentions that strategic information communication can change their perceptions of social trust.<br/>

<h2><b>The COVID-19 Vaccination and Vaccine Inequity Worldwide: An Empirical Study Based on Global Data</b></h2>
<p>with Chuanlin Ning, Han Wang, Jing Wu, Qinwei Chen, and Hao Gao<br/>
<i><u>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</u></i>, 2022, 19(9): 5267.<br/>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095267" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Link]</a>     <a href="paper1.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[PDF]</a><br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: Vaccination is critical for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the progress of COVID-19 vaccination varies from different countries, and global vaccine inequity has been a worldwide public health issue. This study collected data from the Our World in Data COVID-19 vaccination data set between 13 December 2020 and 1 January 2022. The measurement reflecting the pandemic situation included New cases, New deaths, Hospital patients, ICU patients, and the Reproduction rate. Indicators for measuring the vaccination coverage included Total vaccinations per hundred and People vaccinated per hundred. The Human Development Index (HDI) measured the country’s development level. Findings indicated that countries with higher HDI have more adequate vaccine resources, and global vaccine inequity exists. The study also found that vaccination significantly mitigates the pandemic, and reaching 70% immunization coverage can further control the epidemic. In addition, the emergence of Omicron variants makes the COVID-19 epidemic situation even worse, suggesting the importance and necessity of addressing vaccine inequity. The globe will face a greater challenge in controlling the pandemic if lower-vaccinated countries do not increase their vaccination coverage. Addressing the issue of vaccine inequity needs the cooperation of HIC, LMIC, public health departments, and vaccine producers. Moreover, the media has to contribute to effective public health communication by raising public perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination, and vaccine inequity.<br/>
